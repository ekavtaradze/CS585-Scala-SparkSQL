GROUP: Elene Kavtaradze and Michael Ludwig
This submission is by Elene Kavtaradze and includes problems 1 and 4.

The whole project is built through SBT
Question One:
    Run QuestionOne class, as scala

Cal add main, delete app because toDF doesn't work anymore

Question Four:
    Run QuestionFour class, as scala
    Matrix Creation is done through Java and stored in /data
    Scala part of Question four picks files from /data
    
    Requirement were not super specific, so question four joins
    the two datasets, then groups them and sums
